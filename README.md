## Overview

This repository contains the source code and design files for an interactive 3D-printed museum exhibit. The project involves modifying an STL file to create a hollow structure, integrating an MPU6050 sensor, and synchronizing its real-time movement using Python and Arduino.

## Features

- Hollowed STL object design for MPU6050 integration.
- Python program for real-time object rendering.
- Arduino sketch for MPU6050 sensor integration.
- High-precision real-time motion data capture.

## Technologies Used

- 3D Modeling: Blender
- Python: Python 3.7/3.9 - OpenGL library
- Arduino: Teensey 3.2 board, MPU6050 light library

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install necessary packages from requirements.txt in Pycharm

### Installation

1. Have Pycharm Installed
2. Use 3.7/3.9 python Interpreter
3. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
4. Connect the model through a usb port using a micro-usb cable
5. Run the program and choose a port

### Usage

Software updates in real time - you can manually control the object by using the arrow keys if you dont have the model
