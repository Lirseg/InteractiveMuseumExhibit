## Overview

This repository contains the source code and design files for an interactive 3D-printed museum exhibit. The project involves modifying an STL file to create a hollow structure, integrating an MPU6050 sensor, and synchronizing its real-time movement using Python and Arduino.

## Features

- Hollowed STL object design for MPU6050 integration.
- Python program for real-time object rendering.
- Arduino sketch for MPU6050 sensor integration.
- High-precision real-time motion data capture.

## Technologies Used

- 3D Modeling: [Specify 3D modeling software used, e.g., Blender]
- Python: [Specify Python libraries and frameworks used]
- Arduino: [Specify Arduino board and libraries used]
- OpenGL: [Explain the use of OpenGL for rendering]
